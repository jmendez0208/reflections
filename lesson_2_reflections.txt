What happens when you initialize a repository?
A .git directory is created.
Why do you need to do it?
It is needed for .git to store metadata
of files, changes, etc.to be able to do
its work

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
It is feature of Git. Files on it are, for sure,
in the directory, but ready to be commited.
Only files in staging are are committed.

What value do you think it offers?
It offers the posibility of
commiting certain files on the directory
at once, hence allowing for a "logical commit".

How can you use the staging area to 
make sure you have one commit per logical change?

By adding to the staged area only the files
related to a logical change and then do the commit

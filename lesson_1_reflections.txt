Some utilities help, for example FC.

How could having easy access to the entire
history of a file make you a more efficient 
programmer in the long term?
1. Easy compare of different versions.
2. Have a backup when needed.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually
choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git,
vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Manual is better.

Why do you think some version control systems, 
like Git, allow saving multiple files in one 
commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat
each file separately?

It is more appropiate for code.

How can you use the commands git
log and git diff to view the history of files?

With git log shows the history of commits.
In the bottom is the master.
With git diff you can compare any commit with
the previous one and see the differences.
Note: The previous one is below in screen.
(Master is in bottom)

How might using version control make you
more confident to make changes that could break something?

I can always revert back to any version that works.

Now that you have your workspace set up,
what do you want to try using Git for?

I would to use its basic features.

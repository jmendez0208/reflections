Why might you want to always pull changes
manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because I need to make sure the changes on the local
repository are ready/need the changes on the
remote repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.
When would you use one instead of another?

fork -> To copy a repository from other people acount
to my account in Github. Use for work on this, since
I do not have permission to work on other people's 
account.

Clone -> It is copy from my remote repository to
my local PC. Use to work locally on my PC.

Branch -> Create a copy of my local respository
in another thread where I can experiment features.
